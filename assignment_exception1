    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, \n",

    "The key differences between exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
    "Cause: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when an exceptional condition \n",
    "arises, such as invalid input or unexpected situations. Syntax errors occur during the\n",

    "Handling: Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks. You can write code to catch\n",

    "the program flow and provide appropriate error handling. Syntax errors, on the other\n",
    "hand, prevent the program from running altogether until the errors are fixed.\n",
    "Error messages: Exceptions provide detailed error messages that describe the cause\n",
    "and type of exception that occurred. These messages can help with debugging and \n",
    "identifying the root cause of the issue. Syntax errors, on the other hand, usually\n",
